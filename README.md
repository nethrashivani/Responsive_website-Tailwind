## 📱 **Responsive Web Design Practice – Tailwind CSS**

### 🎯 Overview

This project was built to practice **responsive web design** using **Tailwind CSS**.
The goal was to understand how layouts adapt across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using Tailwind’s utility classes.

This helped me learn:

* Mobile-first design
* Tailwind responsive breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, etc.)
* Flexbox & Grid with Tailwind
* Scalable UI structure
* Real-world responsive behavior

### 🚀 Features

* ✅ Fully responsive UI
* ✅ Tailwind utility-first styling
* ✅ Clean and modern layout
* ✅ Mobile-first workflow
* ✅ Real-time rapid styling via Tailwind
